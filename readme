Hereâ€™s the updated README.md that reflects the use of Expectation-Maximization (EM) for Gaussian mixing:

Bayesian Spam-Ham Classifier, Regression with Corrupted Variables, and PCA Clustering
Overview
This repository contains implementations of the following machine learning techniques:

Bayesian Spam-Ham Classifier:

A classifier designed to differentiate between spam and ham messages in the SMS Spam Collection dataset.
Regression with Corrupted Variables:

Applied to the California Housing dataset.
Incorporates random Gaussian noise to better model the housing data, leading to more accurate regression.
Gaussian Mixing Using Expectation-Maximization (EM):

Implements the EM algorithm for Gaussian mixture modeling, enabling probabilistic classification and clustering.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA):

Used for clustering and dimensionality reduction on the Iris dataset.
